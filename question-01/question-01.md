My proudest professional achievement was making a React component library while I was working at InComm InCentives. We, the software engineers, were struggling to communicate with our UX Designer. He would use make mockups and wireframes using tools that we didn't have access to. We would try to get as close to his mockups as we could, but there was always something we missed that he would have to point out. He would bring up in meetings how he felt like he wasn't being heard. So I took it upon myself to work with him to create a library of React components, which gave us the ability to have a common language. His mockups could be labelled with the same names as the React components and we all became a bit more productive.
